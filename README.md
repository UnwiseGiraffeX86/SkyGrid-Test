# SkyGrid: The Web3 City Management System

## Project Overview

The SkyGrid City Management System is an innovative platform designed to enhance urban management and community engagement through the integration of advanced technology and citizen participation. It utilizes real-time data, machine learning algorithms, and blockchain rewards to improve city operations, manage emergencies, and foster a collaborative relationship between city authorities and residents.

### Key Features

-**Real-Time Weather Data Visualization:** Interactive dashboards that display current weather conditions across cities, enhanced by real-time user-contributed images documenting local weather phenomena.

-**Predictive Weather Impact Analysis:** Advanced forecasts of weather impacts on city operations, leveraging both meteorological data and user-submitted photos to refine predictions.

-**Live Traffic Congestion Management:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time traffic data and dynamically manage congestion, improving flow and reducing delays across urban networks.

-**Adaptive Infrastructure Management:** Dynamic adjustment of city infrastructure based on real-time and predictive weather data, with systems responsive to user-reported conditions.

-**Emergency Alerts:** Generate immediate alerts through machine learning validation of user-submitted pictures depicting severe weather or traffic incidents. Contributors are rewarded with SkyGrid Tokens (SKD) proportionate to the incident's severity, enhancing timely and accurate reporting.

-**Community Engagement Platform:** A portal for citizens to contribute data, including pictures of traffic or weather events, and participate in decision-making. Contributors are rewarded with SkyGrid Tokens and earn NFTs for each upload milestone (10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, etc.). Both SkyGrid Tokens and NFTs are managed on the MultiverseX platform, enhancing engagement and value for community contributions.

## Technologies Used and To Be Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Backend**: Genezio 
- **Data Processing and AI**: Python (libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch for machine learning models)
- **Blockchain**: MultiverseX
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage
- **APIs**: RESTful API development for system integration and data access(TomTom, Google Cloud, OpenWeather Map)
