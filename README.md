# SkyGrid

## Project Overview

SkyGrid is a cutting-edge platform designed to enhance urban planning and management by integrating real-time and predictive weather data. This AI-driven system optimizes city operations, minimizes weather-related disruptions, and enhances public safety and comfort. Leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures data integrity, transparency, and efficient resource management.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards displaying weather conditions.
- **Predictive Weather Impact Analysis**: Forecasts of weather impacts on city operations.
- **Adaptive Infrastructure Management**: Dynamic adjustment of city infrastructure based on weather predictions.
- **Emergency and Disaster Management**: Coordinated response mechanisms for weather-related emergencies.
- **Community Engagement Platform**: A portal for citizens to contribute data and participate in decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with React.js for dynamic UI components)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django for the server-side application)
- **Data Processing and AI**: Python (libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch for machine learning models)
- **Blockchain**: Solidity for smart contracts, Ethereum for the blockchain network
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage
- **APIs**: RESTful API development for system integration and data access
